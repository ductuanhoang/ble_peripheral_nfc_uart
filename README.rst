The NFC pairing sample demonstrates Bluetooth® LE out-of-band pairing using an NFC tag and the NFC TNEP protocol.
You can use it to test the touch-to-pair feature between Nordic Semiconductor's devices and an NFC polling device with Bluetooth LE support, for example, a mobile phone.


# Bluetooth: NFC pairing
* The NFC pairing sample demonstrates Bluetooth® LE out-of-band pairing using an NFC tag and the NFC TNEP protocol.
You can use it to test the touch-to-pair feature between Nordic Semiconductor's devices and an NFC polling device with Bluetooth LE support, for example, a mobile phone.

## How to build this project
* Build with zephyr and VsCode
## How to control it
* Tab your phone to the device get NFC information about the device and connect to the device via Bluetooth
* User can user Nrf scaner of Nordic scan and connect to the device
